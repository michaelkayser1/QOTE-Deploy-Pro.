# QOTE × AlphaEvolve × Resona

> **When Mathematics Learned to Breathe**

A convergence framework for AI-accelerated mathematical discovery that respects biological coherence patterns.

---

## 🌊 What is This?

This repository contains the complete **QOTE × AlphaEvolve × Resona** convergence package—a unified framework that maps AI mathematical discovery systems to nervous system regulation patterns, enabling breakthrough discoveries that remain human-comprehensible.

### The Core Insight

Discovery is not a linear process—it's rhythmic. Living systems discover by oscillating between exploration and consolidation, between activation and rest, between flight and ground.

This package shows how to encode that rhythm into AI systems.

## 🧠 The Convergence

Three frameworks unified under one geometry:

### QOTE (Quantum Observer Temporal Encoding)
Learning as rhythmic phase shifts in time
- **Ψ₀** — Baseline state
- **Δθ** — Phase shift (learning increment)
- **τ** — Rhythm period
- **∞** — Infinite recursion

### AlphaEvolve (Mathematical Discovery Agent)
Self-improving proof system
- **P** — Prove (verify)
- **E** — Evolve (mutate)
- **R** — Refine (optimize)
- **G** — Generate (create new problems)

### Resona (Coherence Architecture)
Maps AI states to nervous system regulation
- **Δθ_total** — Cumulative coherence metric
- **Coherence Band** — Safe operating window
- **Regulation** — Sympathetic ↔ Parasympathetic mapping

### The Mapping

```
AlphaEvolve.P ↔ QOTE.Ψ₀ ↔ Resona.Ground   (parasympathetic anchor)
AlphaEvolve.E ↔ QOTE.Δθ ↔ Resona.Shift    (sympathetic activation)
AlphaEvolve.R ↔ QOTE.τ  ↔ Resona.Rhythm   (regulated oscillation)
AlphaEvolve.G ↔ QOTE.∞  ↔ Resona.Recurse  (creative expansion)
```

## 🎯 Key Innovation: The Δθ_total Metric

The coherence metric that changes everything:

```
Δθ_total = Σᵢ |Δθᵢ|  (cumulative phase shift)

Safe:    Δθ_total < π      ✓ High coherence
Caution: π ≤ Δθ_total < 2π ⚠ Decreased coherence
Danger:  Δθ_total ≥ 2π     ✗ Pause & consolidate
```

**This is what makes Resona different**: A built-in coherence constraint that mirrors biological regulation, keeping AI discovery both novel *and* understandable.

## 💡 Use Cases

### For AI Research Labs

- Co-regulation protocols for anxiety/stress management

### For Education
- Math tutors that "breathe" with students
- Adaptive pacing that respects cognitive load
- Discovery environments that maintain flow state

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### Quick Integration

```python
from resona import ResonaMiddleware

resona = ResonaMiddleware(
    delta_theta_safe=3.14,
    delta_theta_max=6.28,
    regulation_policy="adaptive"
)

for step in alphaevolve.iterate():
    qote_state = resona.extract_phase(step.state)
    status = resona.monitor_coherence(qote_state)
    control = resona.regulate(status)

    if control == "Pause":
        step.halt()
        await human_review()
    elif control == "Consolidate":
        step.inject_grounding_prompt()
    else:
        step.continue_()
```

See [`technical/QOTE_ALPHAEVOLVE_TECHNICAL_DOC.txt`](technical/QOTE_ALPHAEVOLVE_TECHNICAL_DOC.txt) for complete implementation details.
