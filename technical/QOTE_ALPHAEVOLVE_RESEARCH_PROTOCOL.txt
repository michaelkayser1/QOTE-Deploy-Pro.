  1. RESEARCH OVERVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION:
  Can AI mathematical discovery systems maintain human-aligned coherence
  while exploring beyond human intuition by incorporating biologically-
  inspired regulation patterns?

SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
  1. Does the Δθ_total metric predict human comprehension of AI proofs?
  2. Do Resona-regulated systems produce more novel yet understandable proofs?
  3. Can human nervous system states synchronize with AI state transitions?
  4. Does co-regulation improve collaborative problem-solving performance?
  5. Can therapeutic AI be paced to client nervous system regulation?
  6. Do neurodivergent individuals benefit from customized τ pacing?

HYPOTHESIS:
  Systems governed by QOTE × AlphaEvolve × Resona convergence will:
    • Generate novel mathematical discoveries (>= AlphaProof baseline)
    • Maintain higher human comprehension (> unregulated baseline)
    • Show phase synchronization with human HRV oscillations
    • Improve collaborative task performance (> asynchronous baseline)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
  • Δθ_total correlates (r > 0.6) with human comprehension ratings
  • Resona-regulated proofs score higher on novelty + clarity composite
  • Significant (p < 0.05) phase locking between AI and human rhythms
  • 20%+ improvement in collaborative discovery outcomes

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

2.1 TRACK 1: MATHEMATICAL DISCOVERY BENCHMARKING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective:
  Validate that Resona-regulated AlphaEvolve maintains or improves
  mathematical discovery capability while enhancing coherence.

Dataset:
  • IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad) problems 2000-2024
  • MATH benchmark (Hendrycks et al.)
  • Lean mathlib contributed theorems
  • Custom-generated algebra, number theory, geometry problems

Conditions:
  1. Baseline AlphaEvolve (no Resona regulation)
  2. Resona-regulated (Δθ_max = π)
  3. Resona-regulated (Δθ_max = 2π)
  4. Resona-regulated (adaptive threshold)

Metrics:
  • Proof success rate (% problems solved)
  • Average proof length (steps)
  • Δθ_total per proof
  • Time to solution
  • Human comprehension rating (1-5 scale, expert mathematicians)

Protocol:
  1. Randomly assign 200 problems to 4 conditions (50 each)
  2. Run each system until solution or timeout (1 hour)
  3. Log all state transitions with Δθ annotations
  4. Present proofs to 5 expert raters (blind to condition)
  5. Collect ratings: correctness, novelty, clarity, elegance

Statistical Analysis:
  • ANOVA: condition × (success rate, comprehension)
  • Correlation: Δθ_total vs. comprehension rating
  • Regression: Δθ_total + proof length → comprehension
  • Qualitative: Expert interviews on proof quality

Expected Timeline: 3-6 months

2.2 TRACK 2: COHERENCE METRIC VALIDATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective:
  Establish that Δθ_total is a valid, reliable metric for proof coherence
  and human understanding.

Design:
  Within-subjects, repeated measures

Participants:
  • N = 30 mathematicians (PhD or advanced PhD students)
  • Diverse specializations (algebra, topology, analysis, etc.)

Materials:
  • 60 AI-generated proofs spanning wide Δθ_total range (0.1 to 10 radians)
  • Each proof paired with Δθ_total value (hidden from participants initially)

Procedure:
  Session 1 (Week 1):
    1. Present 60 proofs in randomized order
    2. For each proof, participant rates:
       - Comprehension (1-7): "How well do you understand this proof?"
       - Novelty (1-7): "How surprising is this approach?"
       - Confidence (1-7): "How confident are you in its correctness?"
    3. Time spent per proof logged

  Session 2 (Week 2):
    1. Reveal Δθ_total values
    2. Show scatter plot: participant's comprehension vs. Δθ_total
    3. Semi-structured interview:
       - Does the pattern match your experience?
       - Were there outliers? Why?
       - What factors besides Δθ contribute to comprehension?

Analysis:
  • Correlation: Δθ_total vs. comprehension (expected r = -0.6 to -0.8)
  • Mixed-effects model: comprehension ~ Δθ_total + (1|participant) + (1|proof)
  • Threshold detection: At what Δθ_total does comprehension drop sharply?
  • Qualitative coding of interview themes

Expected Timeline: 2-3 months

2.3 TRACK 3: NERVOUS SYSTEM SYNCHRONIZATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective:
  Demonstrate phase synchronization between AI state transitions (Δθ)
  and human nervous system regulation (HRV).

Design:
  Repeated measures, within-subjects

Participants:
  • N = 40 healthy adults
  • Screened for cardiac arrhythmia (exclusion criterion)

Equipment:
  • Polar H10 chest strap (HRV monitoring)
  • Eye-tracking (optional, for attention analysis)
  • Screen recording of AI proof generation

Conditions:
  1. Resona-synchronized: AI paced to participant's HRV rhythm
  2. Fixed rhythm: AI paced at τ = 10s (constant)
  3. Unconstrained: AI runs at natural speed

Procedure:
  1. Baseline HRV recording (5 min rest)
  2. Extract participant's dominant HRV frequency (typically ~0.1 Hz)
  3. Condition 1: Set AI τ = 1/(HRV frequency)
     Conditions 2-3: Fixed or unconstrained τ
  4. Participant observes AI solving 3 math problems (~20 min)
  5. After each problem:
     - Comprehension rating
     - Cognitive load rating (NASA-TLX)
     - Engagement rating

Physiological Measures:
  • HRV metrics: SDNN, RMSSD, LF/HF ratio
  • Phase-locking value (PLV) between AI Δθ rhythm and HRV
  • Respiratory rate (if equipment available)

Analysis:
  • Repeated-measures ANOVA: condition × (PLV, comprehension, engagement)
  • Hypothesis: Condition 1 (synchronized) shows highest PLV and engagement
  • Correlation: PLV vs. comprehension within Condition 1
  • Time-frequency analysis: coherence between AI and HRV signals

Expected Timeline: 4-6 months

2.4 TRACK 4: HUMAN–AI CO-DISCOVERY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective:
  Evaluate whether Resona-regulated AI improves collaborative mathematical
  discovery compared to unregulated AI.

Design:
  Between-subjects, collaborative problem-solving

Participants:
  • N = 60 undergraduate/graduate math students
  • Randomly assigned to 3 conditions (20 per condition)

Conditions:
  1. Resona-regulated AI partner (adaptive Δθ_max)
  2. Unregulated AI partner (AlphaEvolve only)
  3. Human-only control (pair with peer)

Task:
  • Solve 5 novel mathematical puzzles (e.g., find patterns, prove conjectures)
  • 60 minutes per puzzle
  • Collaborative: participant can query AI or peer, AI/peer responds

Interaction Protocol:
  • Participant types questions/conjectures
  • AI responds with proof attempts or refinements
  • Resona condition: AI may pause to "consolidate" (visible to user)
  • All interactions logged

Metrics:
  • Number of puzzles solved correctly
  • Time to solution
  • Number of interactions (questions/responses)
  • Participant satisfaction (post-task survey)
  • Δθ_total per session (AI conditions)
  • Trust in AI (Likert scale, post-task)

Analysis:
  • ANOVA: condition × (puzzles solved, satisfaction, trust)
  • Hypothesis: Resona condition >= unregulated on solutions,
              significantly higher on satisfaction and trust
  • Mediation analysis: Does Δθ_total mediate relationship between
                        condition and satisfaction?

Expected Timeline: 3-4 months

2.5 TRACK 5: CLINICAL THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective:
  Pilot therapeutic AI co-regulation for anxiety/stress management.

Design:
  Randomized controlled trial (RCT), parallel groups

Participants:
  • N = 60 adults with mild-moderate anxiety (GAD-7 score 5-14)
  • Recruited via clinical partners
  • IRB approval required

Conditions:
  1. Resona-paced AI therapist (synchronized to HRV)
  2. Fixed-pace AI therapist (standard CBT chatbot)
  3. Waitlist control

Intervention:
  • 8 sessions over 4 weeks
  • Each session: 30 min guided conversation with AI
  • Resona condition: AI adjusts pacing based on real-time HRV
    - High HRV (parasympathetic): Deeper exploration (higher Δθ)
    - Low HRV (sympathetic): Grounding, consolidation (lower Δθ)

Measures:
  • Primary: GAD-7 (anxiety), PHQ-9 (depression) at baseline, week 4, week 8
  • Secondary: HRV metrics, session engagement, therapeutic alliance scale
  • Process: Δθ_total per session, regulation events log

Analysis:
  • Mixed-effects model: (GAD-7 score) ~ time × condition + (1|participant)
  • Hypothesis: Resona condition shows greater anxiety reduction than fixed
  • Mediation: HRV improvement mediates treatment effect
  • Qualitative: Exit interviews on experience with AI pacing

Ethical Considerations:
  • Clear informed consent: "AI is experimental, not replacement for human care"
  • Safety monitoring: Trained clinician reviews all transcripts weekly
  • Crisis protocol: AI detects crisis language → immediate human handoff
  • Right to withdraw at any time

Expected Timeline: 6-12 months (including IRB approval)

2.6 TRACK 6: NEURODIVERGENT OPTIMIZATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Objective:
  Investigate whether custom τ pacing improves AI interaction for
  neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, autism spectrum).

Design:
  Within-subjects, personalized τ optimization

Participants:
  • N = 30 adults with ADHD diagnosis (DSM-5 criteria)
  • N = 30 adults with autism spectrum diagnosis
  • Community recruitment + clinical partners

Phases:
  Phase 1: Baseline Assessment
    • Measure natural cognitive rhythm via behavioral tasks
    • Reaction time variability, tapping rhythm, reading pace
    • Extract personal τ_optimal

  Phase 2: Calibration
    • Interact with AI at 5 different τ values:
      [0.5×τ_optimal, 0.75×, 1.0×, 1.25×, 1.5×]
    • Task: Explain complex topic with AI's help
    • Rate: comprehension, frustration, flow state

  Phase 3: Validation
    • Use τ that scored highest in Phase 2
    • 4-week intervention: daily 15-min AI learning sessions
    • Topics: participant's choice (math, science, history, etc.)

Measures:
  • Engagement (session completion rate)
  • Learning outcomes (quiz performance)
  • Subjective experience (flow, frustration, focus)
  • HRV (if equipment available)

Analysis:
  • Identify optimal τ ratio per individual
  • Cluster analysis: Do ADHD/autism groups prefer different τ?
  • Correlation: How much does personalized τ improve outcomes vs. default?
  • Case studies: Interview 5 participants about their experience

Expected Timeline: 4-6 months

  3. SHARED METHODOLOGIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HRV MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Equipment:
  • Polar H10 chest strap (gold standard for HRV)
  • Backup: PPG from smartwatch (lower accuracy, acceptable)

Procedure:
  1. 5-minute baseline: seated rest, eyes open, controlled breathing (optional)
  2. Extract R-R intervals (time between heartbeats)
  3. Compute metrics:
     - SDNN: Standard deviation of R-R intervals
     - RMSSD: Root mean square of successive differences
     - LF/HF: Low frequency / high frequency power ratio
  4. Identify dominant frequency in 0.05-0.15 Hz band (HRV rhythm)

Quality Control:
  • Artifact detection: Remove R-R intervals >20% deviation from local mean
  • Minimum 5 minutes clean data required
  • Visual inspection of tachogram

PHASE-LOCKING VALUE (PLV) CALCULATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

To measure synchronization between AI Δθ rhythm and HRV:

  1. Extract phase time series:
     - AI: φ_AI(t) = cumulative Δθ over time
     - HRV: φ_HRV(t) via Hilbert transform of R-R interval signal

  2. Compute phase difference:
     Δφ(t) = φ_AI(t) - φ_HRV(t)

  3. Phase-locking value:
     PLV = |⟨e^(i·Δφ(t))⟩_t|

  4. Interpretation:
     PLV = 0: No synchronization (random phase relation)
     PLV = 1: Perfect synchronization (fixed phase relation)
     PLV > 0.3: Significant synchronization (typical threshold)

HUMAN COMPREHENSION RATING PROTOCOL
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

For all studies involving proof evaluation:

  1. Present proof in standardized format (LaTeX or structured text)
  2. No time limit (but log time spent)
  3. Rating scales (1-7 Likert):

     Comprehension:
       1 = "I don't understand this at all"
       4 = "I understand the main idea"
       7 = "I understand every step perfectly"

     Novelty:
       1 = "Completely standard approach"
       4 = "Somewhat novel"
       7 = "Extremely novel/creative"

     Confidence:
       1 = "Highly doubt this is correct"
       4 = "Probably correct"
       7 = "Definitely correct"

  4. Optional: "Explain the key insight" (qualitative)

  5. Raters blinded to condition when possible
